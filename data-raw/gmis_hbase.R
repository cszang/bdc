#' ## Global Human Built-up And Settlement Extent (HBASE) Dataset From Landsat, v1 (2010)

#' To provide high spatial resolution estimates of global urban extent derived from global 30m Landsat satellite data 
#' for the target year 2010 and a companion dataset to the Global Man-made Impervious Surface (GMIS) dataset.

#' The Global Human Built-up And Settlement Extent (HBASE) Dataset from Landsat is a global map of 
#' HBASE derived from the Global Land Survey (GLS) Landsat dataset for the target year 2010. 
#' The HBASE dataset consists of two layers: 1) the HBASE mask; and 2) the pixel-wise probability of HBASE. 
#' These layers are co-registered to the same spatial extent at a common 30m spatial resolution. 
#' The spatial extent covers the entire globe except Antarctica and some small islands. 
#' This dataset is one of the first global, 30m datasets of urban extent to be derived from the GLS data for 
#' 2010 and is a companion dataset to the Global Man-made Impervious Surface (GMIS) dataset. 
#' The HBASE mask was created for post-processing of the GMIS dataset, but can also be utilized by users needing a binary map. 
#' The dataset is expected to have a rather broad spectrum of users, from those wishing to examine/study the fine 
#' details of urban land cover over the globe at full 30m resolution to global modelers trying to understand the 
#' climate/environmental impacts of man-made surfaces at continental to global scales. 
#' For example, the data are applicable to local modeling studies of urban impacts on the energy, water, and carbon cycles, 
#' as well as analyses at the individual country level.
